# fredslam

This is my attempt at monocular SLAM. It's inspired by George Hotz's
TwitchSLAM, which I loosely follow. The plan is to use OpenCV's built in
functions to get a skeleton working, then I'll replace them with my own
functions.

The end goal is to use this to build a Roomba to clean my apartment, which I've
been neglecting in order to get this project done. 

To build - 

make main
./main
